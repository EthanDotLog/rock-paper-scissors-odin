        <h2>Rules of the game</h2>
        <p>If you win, get a point, and have a chance to win the next round. But if you lose, you'll be one step closer to elimination. at 5 loses you are eliminated... here is a reminder on what your options are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rock: Rock on, dude! A solid choice, but can be beaten by paper</li>
            <li>Paper: Paper cuts are the worst... A versatile choice, but can be beaten by scissors</li>
            <li>Scissors: I'm not sure why scissors are in this game, they're clearly the worst choice. But whatever, I'm here for a good time, not a long time! A risky choice, but can beat rock</li>
        </ul>
        <p>best of luck out there, the computer is fierce!!!</p>
